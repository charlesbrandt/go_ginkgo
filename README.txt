Go Ginkgo
=============

Go Ginkgo is a web based (HTML + Javascript) Go board. It uses the KnockoutJS library to handle data binding between the DOM and Javascript. This enables some nice benefits, like scaling to the size of the container.

Go Ginkgo is released under the MIT license with the hopes that it will be useful as a foundation for other web based Go clients. 

It is currently (2014.08.21) lacking SGF integration for playback of existing games and saving the current game. 

While working on this codebase, I've come across other promising web based go clients.

EidoGo
----------
EidoGo is one of the originals in this space. It is a robust and fully featured client. The layout is a fixed size though, so it won't adapt well to different display configurations:
