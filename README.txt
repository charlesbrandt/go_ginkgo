Go Ginkgo
=============

Go Ginkgo is a web based (HTML + Javascript) Go board. It uses KnockoutJS to handle data binding between the DOM and Javascript. This enables some nice benefits, like scaling to the size of the container.

Go Ginkgo is released under the MIT license with the hopes that it will be useful as a foundation for other web based Go clients.
