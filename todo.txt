review game mode...
allows you to make move options
then toggle to see the actual move
and move forward from actual move

*2014.10.14 08:46:43
show peers (other stones / moves with the same parent)
toggle this... don't always want to see this (spoilers)




*2014.10.22 08:18:42
disable page scrolling when touchstart on board happens
having difficulty getting this to work though
have tried applying it in in board.hover_helper() and at board.html binding...
no dice

*2014.10.22 07:12:20
consider moving all hover functionality (especially mouse related...) to using board.hover_helper... seems much more responsive than individual space events

*2014.10.18 08:01:33
change all clickable items to inputs/buttons of some form
makes it easier to see an action via mouse icons

*2014.10.15 04:34:45
way to edit current captures of a node (for getting started later)

*2014.09.14 02:22:53
use captured (dotted circle image) svgs for marking stones that were caputred
(configure if they're shown or not)

*2014.10.19 12:12:08
label marker hover is a bit wonky, but it works...
could clean up layout, but tricky to capture and see why in developer console
(due to hover aspect)

*2014.09.25 20:15:32
some disconnect between player to play property (PL) and next_move in a node...
when saving, don't want to log PL for every node... only if it has been set

*2014.09.10 09:31:18
integrate other SGF fields with DOM interface
*2014.09.10 09:34:13
other SGF properties

*2014.08.07 05:18:50
consider getting size from a container element rather than the whole document during a resize...
that would allow it to be embedded on other sites more easily.

*2014.09.24 17:35:52
show visual representation of game tree

*2014.08.12 10:38:53
use CSS transitions instead of jQuery Fades for button animations

*2013.02.05 09:55:15 
handicap integration

*2013.02.06 18:14:51 
check for kos

*2014.09.10 09:55:38
handle text diagrams with previous moves included
(up to 10 numbers for previous moves)

*2014.09.24 14:47:55
consider a better way to scale text based on size of board

could use:
https://www.google.com/search?q=html+scale+text+to+fit+in+div&oq=html+scale+text+to+fit+in+div&aqs=chrome..69i57.8036j0j1&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8

https://github.com/DanielHoffmann/jquery-bigtext

*2014.09.26 09:06:09
way to show move sequence as labels on stones:
            <li class="action">Show move numbers</li>

*2014.09.26 09:04:39 remote_file
consider if there is a way to do remote file loading...
may require a server component
leaving out for now.
            <li class="action">Open Remote SGF: <input data-bind="value: remote_file" /><button>Go</button></li>

*2013.02.05 09:52:45 
socket.io integration

*2014.08.12 09:36:27
send game via email (this will need a server side component)

*2013.02.06 08:27:41 
    //TODO: click sound

*2013.02.06 13:50:07 
consider using underscore or lo-dash instead of mustache for templates...
need underscore like functionality elsewhere

*2014.08.11 11:09:57
rotate board?
would require translating SGF data

*2014.09.26 09:03:15
<img src="img/arrow-down.svg" class="icon">

*2014.09.26 09:06:30
enable / disable hover functionality...
seems like most cases it's a good thing!
            <li class="action">Show Hover</li>

*2014.09.14 10:53:57
way to change svg stroke color via css
would eliminate the need for many pngs, along with the different black/white/red combinations
also [2014.10.22 07:15:14]
but if svg grid won't show up on some devices, probably can't rely on svg for display purposes in general yet
